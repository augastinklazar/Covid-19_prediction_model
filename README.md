# Required packages.
python-package  --  pystan
python-package  --  fbprophet

- Pre-processing is done on the dataset initially
- Then apply the facebook Prophet model on the data and Predict future data
- Then visualise the predictions (plot the data, the existing and predicted data)
- Then we have to cross validate the data using Prophet
- Finally, obtain the performance metrics for the model, and plot for different errors and conditions for visualisation.
